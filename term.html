                            <p>Poised to radically reconfigure the crypto-asset market, non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are
                                revolutionizing our conception of money and value, creating not just entirely new markets
                                but even new economies that are able to scale globally and to discover value in undreamt
                                places, relegating to oblivion fiat currencies and old ways of doing business..

                            <h2>Selling Condition Tearms &amp; Condition of Nuron</h2>
                            <p>Just kidding. The previous paragraph is a parody (if such is possible) of the hype that in
                                the first half of has come to surround non-fungible tokens. Indeed, the hype has become
                                so overpowering that it may even defy parody. Non-fungible tokens can have legitimacy, and
                                I’ll discuss how that can be at the end of this article. But for now the overwhelming
                                majority of what passes for NFTs is delusion, fueled by the hope of a quick return and the
                                belief that something can be gotten for nothing (or virtually nothing).
                            </p>
                            <p>This is where I can explain and emphasize the “non-fungibility” property of NFTs. The main
                                difference between NFTs and Bitcoins is the fact that Bitcoins are limited, and fungible
                                (you can trade one Bitcoin with another and both have the same value and price). NFTs are
                                unique but unlimited, and non-fungible (no two artworks are the same). While NFTs can
                                appreciate in value (just like real estate), they cannot be interchanged for another NFT.
                            </p>
                            <h2>NFT Bidding Terms &amp; Condition of Nuron</h2>
                            <p>Warren Buffett famously remarked in 2018 that Bitcoin (and by implication all
                                cryptocurrencies) were “probably rat poison squared.” That seems unduly pessimistic given
                                that cryptocurrencies provide a way of securely moving around things that at least look like
                                currency and that in some locales are actually being used like currency. In Venezuela, for
                                instance, Bitcoin provides one way around the country’s corrupt central bank and the
                                hyperinflation it has created. And in early June of , the El Salvador government even
                                approved Bitcoin as legal tender.
                            </p>
                            <p>While not directly related to NFTs, it’s important to mention some properties of money. Among
                                many properties, money has to be fungible (one unit is viewed as interchangeable as
                                another), and divisible (can be divided into smaller units of value). NFTs are not fungible
                                nor (easily) divisible.
                                For example, a single dollar is easily convertible into four quarters or ten dimes, but
                                currently you cannot divide one NFT (although the blockchain technology behind may allow it
                                in future).

                            <p>The importance of NFTs lies in providing the ability to securely value, purchase and exchange
                                digital art using a digital ledger. NFTs started in online gaming, later with Nike’s
                                patenting of its authenticity (CryptoKicks) and then by the famous Christie’s auction
                                embracing NFT valuation of a digital art piece.
                                NFTs are commonly created by uploading files, such as digital artwork, to an auction market.
                                Just like any other form of art, NFTs are not mutually interchangeable, making them more
                                like “collectible” items.
